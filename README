A* for C++ by Dustin Morrison

The fastest way to solve a single-pair shortest path problem for a nonuniform
weighted undirected graph is by using the A* search algorithm.

Most single-pair solutions for other types of graphs use the A* as a base, so
this version was written keeping that in mind.

Terms:
Graph - a complete set of vertices and edges
Vertex - the building blocks of graphs
Edge - the connection of two vertices
Weight - the cost of using an edge to get to a neighboring vertex
Source - the starting vertex
Destination - the ending vertex
